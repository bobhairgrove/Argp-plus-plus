TODO: Argp++

1.  `make dist` works, but `make distcheck` gives an error about `*.Po` files
    left behind in the `examples` subfolders after `make distclean` runs. 
    This should be fixed, although I'm not sure how, given the way 
    `make examples` currently works.

2.  Get this to build on Microsoft Windows and Mac OSX platforms.
