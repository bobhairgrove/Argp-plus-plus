  * argpp::Factory<T>::createParser now takes an additional argument:
      static T* createParser(  ArgppOptions const &opts = ArgppOptions()
                             , ArgppBase * parent = NULL)
    with a default value of an empty option vector. This makes it easier to 
    initialize the options with literal vector initialization syntax using C++11 
    or later.
    Thanks to Ben Asselstine for this suggestion!
  
  * removed the symbol ARGPP_API from the templated struct argpp::Factory<T>
    since it would not be an exported symbol when building a DLL in 
    Microsoft Windows.
    
  * Added an additional constructor to ArgppOption to facilitate 
    literal initializations.
    
  * updated documentation in the doc subfolder to reflect these changes.
